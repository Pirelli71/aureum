## What We Accomplished

### ✅ Completed Sections (70% of Market Research)

**1. Research Objectives & Methodology**
- Primary objective: Go-to-market strategy development
- Secondary: Customer segment validation, TAM/SAM/SOM calculation
- Research depth: Deep Dive (8+ hours comprehensive)

**2. Market Overview**
- **TAM (2025):** $900M - $1.1B (DeFi portfolio management market)
- **SAM (2025):** $532M (85% chain coverage × 60% English speakers)
- **SOM Target (2028):** $18.6M ARR at 3.5% market share (210K paid users)
- Growth trajectory: $900M (2025) → $2.8B (2028) → $54B+ (2034)

**3. Market Trends & Drivers**
- **DeFAI Convergence:** $16.93B market cap (Jan 2025), growing to $10B+ by EOY
- **AI/DeFi Integration:** Biggest trend, NO current competitors have true AI agents
- **Multi-Chain Complexity:** Users managing 3-7 chains, fragmentation pain
- **LP Sophistication:** Concentrated liquidity requires active management
- **53.8% CAGR:** DeFi market exploding from $21B (2024) → $1.5T (2034)

**4. Customer Analysis - 3 Detailed Segments**

**Segment 1: Retail DeFi Users (PRIMARY)**
- Portfolio: $5K-$100K across 3-8 LP positions
- Current tools: Zapper/DeBank (free), frustrated by 24/7 monitoring burden
- Willingness to pay: $30-60/month (need freemium onboarding)
- Size: 2.4M users (2024) → 9.2M (2028)
- Target conversion: 5-8% = 120K-190K paid users

**Segment 2: DeFi Power Users (SECONDARY)**
- Portfolio: $100K-$5M+ across 15-50 positions on 5-7 chains
- Current spend: $200-500/month across multiple tools
- Willingness to pay: $100-300/month for AI-powered consolidation
- Size: 600K users (2024) → 1.8M (2028)
- Target conversion: 15-25% = 270K-450K paid users

**Segment 3: Newcomers (FUTURE)**
- Portfolio: $500-$5K, just entering DeFi
- Strategy: Free tier with education → upsell as portfolios grow
- Size: 9-11M by 2028

**5. Pricing Strategy (Benchmarked)**
- **Free:** Basic portfolio view (3 chains), limited history
- **Pro ($59/mo or $590/yr):** All 7 chains, AI alerts, IL tracking → RETAIL TARGET
- **Elite ($199/mo or $1,990/yr):** Advanced AI, custom alerts, backtesting → POWER USER TARGET
- **Enterprise ($999/mo+):** Multi-user, API access, compliance → INSTITUTIONAL
- **Positioning:** Below Nansen ($99-999), above Metrix ($40), justified by AI

**6. Competitive Landscape - 5 Deep Analyses**

| Competitor | Focus | Pricing | Threat Level | Gap |
|------------|-------|---------|--------------|-----|
| **Metrix Finance** | LP simulation/tracking | $40/mo | MEDIUM-HIGH | ❌ No AI, manual analysis |
| **Coinbase Wallet** | Wallet-integrated portfolio | Free | MEDIUM | ❌ No AI, basic tracking, Base-focused |
| **Zapper** | Free multi-chain tracker | Free | HIGH | ❌ No AI, no LP specialization |
| **Nansen** | Premium on-chain analytics | $99-999/mo | LOW-MEDIUM | ❌ Too expensive, analytics not management |
| **DeFi Saver** | CDP/lending automation | 0.25% fees | LOW | ❌ No LP, rule-based not AI |

**Key Finding:** NO competitor offers AI + LP Focus + Multi-Chain + Affordable pricing

**7. Competitive Positioning Map**
- **Market Gap Identified:** Upper-middle quadrant (High Intelligence + Mid Price) = UNDERSERVED
- **Aureum Position:** Only player combining AI agents + LP specialization + $59-199 pricing
- **White Space:** AI + LP + Multi-Chain + Affordable = unique combination
- **Differentiation:** "First AI-native DeFi portfolio manager that watches LP positions 24/7 and tells you what to do BEFORE you ask"

**8. Porter's Five Forces Analysis**
- **Overall Attractiveness:** MODERATE-HIGH (growing market, manageable competition)
- **Supplier Power:** LOW-MEDIUM (multiple providers, LLM-agnostic mitigates)
- **Buyer Power:** MEDIUM-HIGH (free alternatives, price sensitivity - need freemium)
- **Competitive Rivalry:** HIGH (many players BUT high growth moderates)
- **Threat of New Entrants:** MEDIUM-HIGH (low barriers, 6-12 month window)
- **Threat of Substitutes:** MEDIUM (wallet AI coming, need MIRA moat)
- **Strategic Imperative:** Move fast, build AI moat, establish brand before commoditization

## Key Insights for Next Session

**1. Core Market Opportunity:**
- $532M SAM in 2025, growing to $1.6B by 2028
- Target 3.5% market share = $18.6M ARR (210K paid users)
- Realistic 3-year target given 53.8% CAGR market growth

**2. Winning Strategy (validated by research):**
- **Freemium model mandatory:** Free tier competes with Zapper/DeBank for acquisition
- **AI is THE moat:** No competitor has true AI agents (6-12 month first-mover window)
- **LP specialization:** Metrix proves $40/mo viable, Aureum adds AI for premium
- **Affordable premium:** $59-199/mo targets retail→power user upgrade path
- **Speed critical:** Wallets could add AI features (Coinbase has distribution advantage)

**3. Customer Segments Validated:**

- Free tools (Zapper) lack intelligence
- Paid tools (Metrix) lack AI
- Premium tools (Nansen) too expensive
- Wallets (Coinbase) lack sophistication
- **Aureum = unique value proposition**

**5. Strategic Imperatives:**
- Move fast (6-12 month window before AI commoditizes)

- Freemium acquisition → paid conversion model
- Consider wallet partnerships (vs. competing with distribution)
